          <h3>Exploring the Latest Web Design Trends</h3>
          <p>
            On a website, micro-interactions are small animations that offer
            subtle feedback to users. One of the most commonly used
            micro-interactions is seeing a link change colors when a user mouses
            over it. With the focus on micro-interactions, that same experience
            might be given more attention to stand out. Imagine a gradient
            slowly shifting hues as you scroll down a page, or a pop of color
            exploding from your mouse after you click an element. These are
            prime examples of elevated micro-interactions that youâ€™ll see more
            often.

          <h3>Tips for Effective UI/UX Design</h3>
          <p>
            A few UI design tips can go a long way to help you create better
            user interfaces. Beyond session times and bounce rates, it's
            sometimes all too easy to forget that the core purpose of user
            interface design is to make things as effortless and enjoyable as
            possible for the user. Some tasks once considered the domain of UX
            designers are now commonly sought after in UI designers, with the
            roles increasingly crossing over.
